Notes:

In theory im saying if what the other person doenst have is a instance of the same card object return false python sees the
instance is a card and proceeds this helps me from data type bugs.

Going foward in the program with eq your telling python that two cards should be treated as the same card only if their 
values (rank & suit) match. // 

In python objects are compared by memory by default not by the values i put inside the instances. 
For a situation like this i would be comparing values not memory comparison which is why the 
Dunder Method  __eq__  come into effect:

Memory Comparison:card1 is card2 
Value Comparison: card1 == card2 

Key Note: Dunder Methods are special built ins methods that define how objects behave with differnt type of operators
& built ins or to compare other ojects.
__str__ > best way to display text with objects instead of memory address representation
__init__ > runs & sets up the objects data 
__eq__ > compares two objects by thier value without it python compares memory instead

Differance:
print() // shows the value on the screen
return // gives the value back to the program silently not the screen
